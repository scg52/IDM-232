        <p>Commodore is a world of precision machinery. The people of Commodore have never been physically remarkable so they turned to technology to make up for their meager stature. The technological prowess and sheer number of soldiers usually wins the fight. If that isn't enough the remarkable skill with tactics win the day. There are several kinds of foot soldiers that the Commodorian army employs. Pilots are the most widely used as their mechs are widely customizable. Strikers are another unit that don a lighter exo-suit for smaller operations. Whatever kind of unit they belong to Commodorians are always on the hunt for knowledge. They excel at strategy and complex machinery. Any Commodorian can retro-fit their personal suit, whether it be mech or exo-suit. This world epitomizes jack of all trades, master of none.</p>

            <p>Pilots each command a powerful mech that they have customized. These one man tanks have become a staple on the Commodorian battlefield. These suits are always at the frontline of any major battle. Most come equiped with energy shields and some form of light machine gun. The downfall of these suits is that they are large and require sufficient power to drive. The power issue has been partially circumvented by the addition of solar power cells. </p>

            <p>Strikers are a select unit of people who have lighter combat exo-suits designed for small strike team operations, hence the name. A Striker's exo-suit, much like a Pilot's mech, are highly customized by the Striker to emphasize their particular strengths and account for their weaknesses. Since a Striker's exo-suit is much smaller than a mech it is much more susceptible to serious damage more quickly. Exo-suits do not have the luxury of having large shield generators so they settle for smaller ones. These smaller generators have a significant weakspot in terms of design. There is a small point at the base of the suit's spine where the shield is projected from and thus cannot protect. This is the reason any Striker lucky enough to survive a failed mission is always paralyzed.</p>
