        <h1>Ragnarok</h1>

      <div class="description">
        <p>Among the cracks and broken glass lie a world in ruin. A few years ago this world was not unlike the one you currently inhabit. Ragnarok is a world in decay. Three years ago the world's two superpowers were driven to bio weaponry to combat each other. This bio weapon mixed with the lingering nuclear radiation left by previous altercations and mutated the bio weapon, and the people exposed to it. Only about a third of the population of Ragnarok are immune to the bio weapon. Those who are immune are usually pre-mutated specimens. These survivors are the remnants of the heroes of times before the fall. Pre-mutated individuals once wielded super strength, speed, or some kind of physiological anomaly.</p>

            <p>Those who are immune to the bio-weapon must scrape together to survive. Carrying the I gene is not an indicator of luck. Carriers have to live in the horror of Ragnarok, constantly being hunted by the Ravagers. Those without a special physiological anomaly either have a trait they call Overwhelmed or rely on biological amplifiers to deal with the hordes of feral dead.</p>

        <h3>Overwhelmed</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Overwhelmed is an ability where the user gains a rush of adrenaline making them more powerful according to how many adversaries they are facing. This works best for survivors who wield melee weapons such as machetes or hatchets.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h3>Bio-Amp</h3>
        <br>
        <p>A bio-amp is usually a liquid enhancement designed for the user only. Each person on Ragnarok has a very different gene makeup making it extremely risky to use a bio-amp on someone who has never been tested with it. These vials of specialized steroids can range from health boosts to damage boosts to even certain resistances. Most people on Ragnarok do not have a formal training in altering biology so many bio-amps end in disaster. The only true method of finding a formula that works is extensive trial and error. Most survivors gain the chemicals by raiding government labs or attempting to create the materials themselves with, agian, usually devestating explosions.</p>

            <p>**This is not a playable race** </p><br>
            <p>Ravagers are the rotting husks of people who did not carry the I gene. A common misconception is that Ravagers are the living dead. They only seem dead due to the fact that they are unable to heal themselves the way regular humans do. Eventually they stop bleeding after being wounded yet the wound itself will never properly heal making them seem to be undead. However their wounds do not stop these feral humans from being a devastating force. Ravagers are usually found in groups of ten to twelve and any group larger is considered a horde. There are also many different kinds of Ravagers since the bio-weapon affected people differently.</p>
